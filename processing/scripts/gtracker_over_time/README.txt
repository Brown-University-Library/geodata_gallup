* NOTES ON GALLUP TRACKER VARIABLES OVER TIME

The files in this folder illustrate which variables were included in the Gallup US Daily Tracker survey over time from 2008 to 2017, for users who wish to do historical comparisons. These files were created by identifying whether a specific variable ID appeared in the data files for multiple survey years. Data users must still read the codebooks and independently verify if and how specific questions and codes have changed over time; these files are merely intended as guides.

gtracker_vars_2008_2017.csv - with variables as rows and years as columns, variables are marked with an 'x' if they appeared in the survey for a particular year.

grtackers_vars_2008_2017.txt - this is a simple list of variables followed by the years they were included in the survey.

Data from 2018 forward is not included, as the structure of the data files changed that year.
