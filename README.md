# Gallup Microdata Processing Scripts
Generate variable lists in Excel and STATA do files for Gallup microdata

1. STATA do files to generate variable lists in Excel from Gallup microdata files. Variable lists are used by students and faculty to indicate what attributes / columns they want in their extracts. These files must be regenerated whenever we receive updated data files from Gallup.
2. Python script to read variables selected in Excel variable list, to create a STATA do file to generate extracts from Gallup microdata files. These files are modified for each request to: select a submitted variable spreadsheet (for columns) and to modify filters (for rows).

This repository contains the scripts, but not the input and output files (Gallup data and variable spreadsheets) as these are copyrighted and licesned for Brown Unviversity users.
